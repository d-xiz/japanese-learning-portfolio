                        I’m Danish Mohamed,a student at <strong>Temasek Polytechnic</strong> who decided to learn
                        Japanese for two very honest reasons: I love anime, and I got tired of pretending subtitles
                        don’t ruin emotional scenes. Somewhere between maintaining a Duolingo streak, mispronouncing
                        basic phrases, and falling down anime research rabbit holes, this project became more than just
                        language learning. It turned into an exploration of how anime quietly shaped global culture —
                        including mine. <br /><br />
                        Purpose-driven, genuinely curious, and always learning.

                        <h3>Guided Learning Overview</h3>

                        <p>
                            Guided Learning is a self-directed learning that allows students to explore a topic of personal interest while following a structured learning framework making the outcome more fruitfull. Instead of traditional classroom-led instruction, students take ownership of their learning by planning objectives, doing activities which enhance learning, progress tracking, reflecting on outcomesand modification learning procedure with respect to facilitators advice.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This project follows the Plan-Perform-Monitor-Reflect (PPMR) framework, which ensures that learning is intentional, trackable, and reflective. The framework encourages continuous improvement through regular self-evaluation and adjustment throughout the learning process.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Learning Project Background</h3>

                        <p>
                           This Guided Learning project focuses on learning basic Japanese language words and phrase with an exploration of Japanese anime culture and its global influence. The project was designed to combine language learning with cultural research, allowing both areas to combine togather and reinforce each other.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Anime was chosen as the cultural focus because of its widespread international reach and its
                            role in shaping perceptions of Japanese language, lifestyle and tourism.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Initial Goals:</strong> I planned to learn basic Japanese communication skills while
                            researching anime's global cultural impact. My decision to combine language learning with
                            cultural research was strategic - I believed understanding the language would enhance my
                            appreciation of anime's cultural nuances.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Planning Decisions:</strong> I chose Duolingo for structured language learning
                            because of its gamified approach and progress tracking. For research, I planned to use
                            academic sources, industry reports, and case studies. My 7-week timeline was designed to
                            allow for gradual skill building while maintaining momentum.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Resource Planning:</strong> I allocated 30 minutes daily for Duolingo practice, 2
                            hours weekly for research, and 1 hour weekly for reflection and documentation. This balanced
                            approach ensured steady progress in both areas.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Language Learning Actions:</strong> I consistently practiced Japanese daily using
                            Duolingo, achieving a 49-day streak. I created flashcards for vocabulary retention, recorded
                            myself speaking weekly to track pronunciation improvement, and practiced conversations with
                            Japanese exchange students online.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Research Actions:</strong> I systematically researched anime's cultural impact by
                            analyzing academic papers, industry reports, and case studies. I documented findings in
                            organized notes, created mind maps to connect different cultural influences, and interviewed
                            peers about their anime-influenced behaviors.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Documentation Actions:</strong> I maintained weekly reflection journals, took
                            screenshots of progress, saved drafts of all work, and organized evidence systematically for
                            portfolio compilation.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Challenges Encountered:</strong> Japanese pronunciation proved more difficult than
                            expected, particularly the subtle differences between similar sounds. Research initially
                            felt overwhelming due to the vast amount of available information about anime's global
                            impact.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Feedback Received:</strong> My language exchange partner noted improvement in my
                            pronunciation after week 4. Peer feedback on my research highlighted the need for more
                            quantitative data to support cultural impact claims.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Adjustments Made:</strong> I increased pronunciation practice by listening to native
                            speakers on YouTube and repeating phrases. For research, I focused on specific, measurable
                            impacts rather than general observations. I also adjusted my study schedule to allocate more
                            time to challenging areas.

                        <h3>💭 REFLECT - What Worked, What Didn't, and Improvements</h3>
                        <p>
                            <strong>What Worked Well:</strong> The combination of language learning and cultural
                            research created synergistic learning - understanding Japanese helped me appreciate anime
                            dialogue nuances, while anime research provided cultural context for language learning.
                            Daily Duolingo practice built strong habits, and weekly recordings clearly showed progress.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>What Didn't Work:</strong> Initially, I underestimated the time needed for quality
                            research. My first attempts at pronunciation were frustrating, and I nearly gave up on
                            speaking practice. Some research sources were too academic and difficult to synthesize.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Key Learning Outcomes:</strong> Beyond language skills and cultural knowledge, I
                            developed stronger self-directed learning abilities, improved research skills, and better
                            time management. I learned the importance of consistent practice and the value of iterative
                            improvement.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Future Improvements:</strong> For future projects, I would allocate more time for
                            skill development phases and seek feedback earlier in the process. I would also incorporate
                            more diverse learning methods from the beginning rather than adding them as adjustments.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Personal Growth:</strong> This project significantly boosted my confidence in
                            self-directed learning and cross-cultural understanding. I'm now more motivated to continue
                            Japanese language study and pursue deeper cultural research projects.
